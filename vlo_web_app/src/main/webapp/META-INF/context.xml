<!-- VLO application context file

path : web application context path. If u is the url of the web server, the web
application will be reachable at u/path

externalConfig : the path to an external configuration file. In this file you 
can set the value of the VLO parameters. 

The specification of an external configuration file is optional. If you do not 
specify one, the VLO web application will use the packaged parameters. This will
only be usefull when the application is run from within a development 
environment. 

In a VLO configuration file, among others, you need to define the value of the 
solrUrl parameter. You can override this value by defining it in the context 
fragement directly. This is not obligatory however.

For more information on the meaning and purpose of the VLO parameters, please
refer to the documentation.
