== Preparing for release ==

These instructions apply to any kind of release, whether it's a stable
version, or for beta or alpha deployment. Always increase the version number
and keep the trunk in -SNAPSHOT but not the tags so that a deployed version
can always be traced back to its sources!

* Make a tag of the version to release:

	svn cp . ../tags/vlo-3.x	#executed from trunk

* Change the version number in the poms to match the release
  (should match the directory name and be non-snapshot!!):

	cd ../tags/vlo-3.x
	mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=3.x

  This will update the version numbers of the parent pom and all VLO
  modules in one go!

* Build the tag and inspect the output of vlo-distribution

	mvn clean install 		#do not skip unit tests ;)

  Unpack the tarball in vlo-distribution/target somehwere and check its
  contents on version numbers, config files etc.

  You may also want to do a 'svn diff' to check the change of the version
  numbers.

* Clean up and commit

	mvn versions:commit 		#cleans up POM backups
	mvn clean			#cleans up build outpit
	svn commit -m "Created tag for VLO version 3.x"

* Update the version number of the trunk if the release was a stable

	cd ../../trunk
	mvn version:set -DnewVersion 3.y-SNAPSHOT
	mvn versions:commit
	svn commit -m "Bumped trunk version to 3.y-SNAPSHOT"

* Done!

After building the entire project, a deployment package will be present in the
'target' directory of vlo-distribution. This includes WARs for both the Solr
and the web app front end as well as the importer script and default configuration
files.
