Upgrading from 2.18 to 3.0

TODO: EXTEND!!
* Web app context params changed, for an overview see META-INF/context.xml
* Config changes
   * Removed list length attribute
   * Added collectionFacet
   * Added config of ignored and technical fields

Upgrading from 2.17 to 2.18

* In version 2.18 of the VLO, the URL mapping has been changed. To prevent
existing references and bookmarks from breaking, add rewrite rules to the
HTTP server to achieve the following mappings:

[TODO: Define actual mod_rewrite rules and document here]

- {vlobase}/?wicket:bookmarkablePage=:eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.pages.ShowResultPage&docId={docId}
	-> {vlobase}/record?docId={docId}

- {vlobase}/?wicket:bookmarkablePage=:eu.clarin.cmdi.vlo.pages.ShowAllFacetValuesPage&selectedFacet={facet}
	-> {vlobase}/values/{facet}

In both case all additional GET parameters SHOULD be kept.

Next to the URL mapping, the XML parameter file has undergone some changes:

    <!-- Sets the maximum number of page instances which will be stored in the application scoped second level cache for faster retrieval -->
    <pagesInApplicationCache>40</pagesInApplicationCache>
    
    <!-- Sets the maximum size (in KILOBYTES) of the File where page instances per session are stored. -->
    <sessionCacheSize>10000</sessionCacheSize>

Has been added to tune the Wicket page cache. The first parameter allows you
to set the size of the application wide cache holding pages. The second parameter
denotes the size of the cache (in kilobytes) associated with a session. The values
listed above are the Wicket defaults.

Other changes in the parameter file:
- maxFileSize and use MaxFileSize have been integrated into one parameter:
  
  maxFileSize

  If equal to 0, no upper limit to the size of metadata input files will be 
  applied.

- maxDaysToLife has been renamed into maxDaysInSolr

- VloHomeLink has been renamed into homeUrl

- helpUrl has been added; a link to a help page.

- The facetConceptsFile parameter, referencing the facetConcepts.xml file, 
  has been added also. This is part of the effort of making parameterised 
  instantiation of the VLO possible.

- Also, the facetOverviewLength parameter has been added. This parameter controls
  the listing of facets on the search page.

- Similar to 'useMaxFileSize' the expectReverseProxy parameter has been removed

Finally, 

    <cqlEndpointFilter>http://cqlservlet.mpi.nl/</cqlEndpointFilter>
    
    <cqlEndpointAlternative>http://cqlservlet.mpi.nl/</cqlEndpointAlternative>

add the possibility of creating a filter for endpoints.
